Reasons for setting constrain:
	Setting the constrain for post layout simulation.
Strategy:
	We release the clock period a little bit to avoid read data error and pass post layout simulation.
	In the end, the period we chose would cause set up time violation during P&R, so we set the period in the testbench a larger number to pass the post layout simulation.
