[Logic of each Testbench]
1. Test_CONV.v: 
    a. first load in weights to 2 SRAMs
    b. we then load in the test photo and set one cycle conv_start
    c. compare SRAM value that store calculated value with correct fmap value to testify the correctness
2. Test_FC.v:
    a. first load in all the needed data
    b. compare the SRAM value that store final probability and fc1 fmap with groundtruth
3. Test_top.v:
    combine both of previous mentioned test logic
4. Test_top_multiple.v:
    test two set correctness
