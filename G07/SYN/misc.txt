[Design Compiler]

We synthesis both one set and two sets lenet acceleremeter and store the result in two different file lenet_1set and lenet_2set.

Reasons for setting constrain:
    The smallest cycle time we could pass, smaller constrain can be modified to pass post_sim later
Strategy: 
    We keep on chasing smaller cycle time at the beginning, however, since there's problem for post simulation, we choose larger cycle time to re-synthesis our design.
